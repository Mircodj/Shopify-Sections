## Installation
Copy the `sectionname.liquid` file from the repository and paste it into the sections folder of your Shopify theme. You can find this folder in the `Online Store > Themes > Actions > Edit Code` section of your Shopify admin.

Once the section is added to your page or template, you can configure it by going to the Shopify theme customizer (`Online Store > Themes > Customize`).

From there, you'll be able to configure the section.
